/**
 * Read/write the primary and **fall back to one or more secondary adapters when

 * the instance's own adapter (reached through the rest of the onion, so it keeps
 * retry and prefixing); the **secondaries** are backup adapters passed in
 * {@link FailoverOptions.secondaries}, tried in order.
 *
 * Every verb runs the same way: try the primary; if it throws and
 * {@link FailoverOptions.shouldFailover} says so (by default, only on a
 * `Provider` error — network / timeout / 5xx), try the next backend, and so on.
 * The first backend that succeeds wins; if the chain is exhausted, the last
 * error is thrown. A definitive answer from a healthy backend (`NotFound`,
 * `Unauthorized`, an aborted request) is **not** failed over — it's surfaced
 * directly, so a genuine 404 stays a 404 instead of being masked by a replica.
 *
 * This is the **availability** counterpart to `tiering()` (which *partitions*
 * data by key/size) — failover treats each secondary as a full replica of one
 * namespace, so it never splits or merges across backends:
 * - **reads** (`download` / `head` / `exists` / `url` / `list`) return the first
 *   reachable backend's answer; `list` is **not** merged (no composite cursor).
 * - **writes** (`upload` / `delete` / `copy` / `move`) land on the first
 *   reachable backend — it does **not** fan out to every backend (that's
 *   `replication()`); a write that fails over during a primary outage lands only
 *   on the secondary.
 * - **`signedUploadUrl`** signs against the first reachable backend.
 * - a **streaming** `upload` (a `ReadableStream` body) can't be replayed, so it
 *   runs against the primary **alone** and isn't failed over.
 *
 * It's **body-transparent** — never buffers or transforms bytes — and adds no
 * surface (`wrap` only), so it works with plain `new Files({ plugins })`.
 *
 * Placement and prefixes:
 * - Place it **last** (innermost) so body-transforming plugins (`encryption()`,
 *   `compression()`) wrap it and apply to **every** backend.
 * - Secondaries receive caller-facing keys (no instance `prefix`), so give each
 *   its own bucket / container and avoid a client `prefix` on a failover
 *   instance.
 *
 * Consistency: failover buys availability, not convergence. An object written to
 * a secondary while the primary was down is invisible to reads once the primary
 * recovers (reads hit the primary first and it answers `NotFound`). Reconcile
 * with `sync` / `transfer`, keep the replica current with `replication()`, or
 * pass a `shouldFailover` that also fails over on `NotFound` to read through.
 *
 * @param options `{ secondaries, shouldFailover?, onFailover? }` — see
 *   {@link FailoverOptions}.
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { Files } from "files-sdk";
 * import { s3 } from "files-sdk/s3";

 *       onFailover: ({ operation, failed }) =>
 *         console.warn(`failover: ${operation} fell off backend ${failed}`),
