/**
 * Turn `delete` into a recoverable move into a trash prefix, and add `trashed()`
 * / `restore()` / `purge()` so you can list, recover, and permanently remove
 * what's been deleted. Instead of destroying an object, a `delete` server-side
 * **moves** it to a time-of-deletion copy under a trash prefix (`.trash/` by
 * default); the bytes only ever leave storage when you `purge()`.
 *
 * Like `versioning()`, it's **body-transparent** — it never buffers, transforms,
 * or reads the body, so streaming, range downloads, `url()`, and
 * `signedUploadUrl()` all keep working — and it has **no native dependencies**.
 * Because it relocates whatever the rest of the pipeline stored, place it
 * **first** (outermost): `plugins: [softDelete(), encryption(key)]`.
 *
 * It uses `extend`, so reach for {@link createFiles} to surface
 * `files.trashed()` / `files.restore()` / `files.purge()` on the type.
 *
 * Trade-offs, by design:
 * - **One copy per key.** A delete relocates to `"<prefix>/<key>"`, so deleting
 *   a key whose trashed copy still exists **replaces** that copy (latest delete
 *   wins). Reach for `versioning()` if you need every deleted generation kept.
 * - **`delete` becomes a `copy` + `delete`.** A soft delete is a move, so it
 *   costs an extra round-trip versus a hard delete. Deleting a key that doesn't
 *   exist stays a no-op, the same as a plain `delete`.
 * - **Direct presigned writes bypass it.** Only deletes through the instance are
 *   trashed; it's a safety net, not a security control, so it doesn't fail
 *   closed the way `validation()` does.
 * - **Trash grows until you `purge()`.** Nothing expires on its own.
 *
 * @param options optional `{ prefix }` — where trashed objects live.
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { createFiles } from "files-sdk";
 * import { s3 } from "files-sdk/s3";
 * import { softDelete } from "files-sdk/soft-delete";
 *
 * const files = createFiles({
 *   adapter: s3({ bucket: "uploads" }),
 *   plugins: [softDelete()],
 * });
 *
 * await files.upload("notes.txt", "hi");
 * await files.delete("notes.txt"); // moved to .trash/notes.txt, not destroyed
 *
 * await files.trashed(); // [{ key: "notes.txt", trashKey: ".trash/notes.txt", … }]
 * await files.restore("notes.txt"); // back to "notes.txt"
 * await files.delete("notes.txt");
 * await files.purge("notes.txt"); // now it's really gone
 * ```
