 * instances, so each leg honors its own instance's `prefix`, retries,
 * timeouts, and hooks.
 *
 * Like the bulk array methods, this does **not** throw on a partial failure:
 * successes land in `transferred`, per-key failures in `errors`, both in walk
 * order. Pass `stopOnError` to bail at the first failure (sequential), or
 * `overwrite: false` to skip keys already present at the destination.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Files, transfer } from "files-sdk";
 * import { s3 } from "files-sdk/s3";
 * import { r2 } from "files-sdk/r2";
 *
 * const from = new Files({ adapter: s3({ bucket: "old" }) });
 * const to = new Files({ adapter: r2({ bucket: "new", ... }) });
 *
 * const { transferred, errors } = await transfer(from, to, {
 *   prefix: "uploads/",
 *   onProgress: ({ done, total, key }) => console.log(`${done}/${total}`, key),
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * The source is walked in full before transfers begin (so `total` is known),
 * but only the keys are buffered — every body still streams. Only the body,
 * content type, and user metadata travel with each object; destination-assigned
 * fields (`etag`, `lastModified`) are fresh, and `Cache-Control` is not carried
 * (a `StoredFile` doesn't expose it). Metadata is dropped for adapters with no
 * metadata primitive, and forwarded keys that a destination adapter rejects
 * (e.g. metadata on Bunny/Appwrite/PocketBase) surface as per-key `errors`.
