// Cross-provider mirror: reconcile a destination against a source instead of
// blindly copying. Where `transfer` is a one-shot copy, `sync` adds the three
// things a backup or incremental migration actually needs — skip objects that
// are already identical at the destination, optionally prune destination keys
// the source no longer has, and preview the whole plan with `dryRun`. Like
// `transfer` it spans two backends and is built entirely on public primitives:
// both instances' `listAll`, the source's streaming `download`, the
// destination's `upload` + bulk `delete`. No adapter implements anything new.
//
// The comparison runs off the metadata `list` already returns (size + etag),
// so the destination is walked exactly once — that same walk drives the prune,
// so the size/etag check is free. Callers who only want the cheap per-key path
// with no prune already have `transfer(overwrite: false)`.

 * - `"etag"` (the default) — unchanged when size **and** etag both match. etags
 *   are only comparable within one scheme: S3↔S3 single-part uploads match, but
 *   across heterogeneous backends (S3 → R2 / GCS / Azure) or for multipart
 *   objects they differ even for identical bytes, so the object is conservatively
 *   re-uploaded. A missing etag on either side counts as changed.
 * - `"size"` — unchanged when byte length matches. Comparable across every
 *   backend, but blind to same-size edits; the right default for cross-provider
 *   mirrors.
 * - a function — full control. Receives the source and destination
 *   {@link StoredFile} metadata and returns `true` when the object should be
 *   skipped (treated as unchanged).
 *
 * `lastModified` is deliberately not used: the destination stamps its own upload
 * time, so it never matches the source after a sync — comparing it would
 * re-upload everything on every run.

/**
 * Mirror the `source` onto the `dest`: upload every object that's new or

 * destination keys the source no longer has. Both arguments are full
 * {@link Files} instances, so each leg honors its own instance's `prefix`,
 * retries, timeouts, and hooks. Changed objects stream download-to-upload, so
 * the destination never sees a buffered copy of a large file.
 *
 * Both sides are walked in full before any work begins (so `total` is known and
 * `dryRun` can report the plan), but only metadata is buffered — every body
 * still streams. Only the body, content type, and user metadata travel with
 * each object, exactly as in {@link transfer}.
 *
 * Like the bulk array methods, this does **not** throw on a partial failure:
 * successes land in `uploaded` / `deleted`, per-key failures in `errors`. Pass
 * `stopOnError` to bail at the first upload failure (sequential; the prune phase
 * is then skipped). Uploads run before prunes, so an interrupted run never
 * leaves the destination missing data it was about to gain.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Files, sync } from "files-sdk";

 * import { r2 } from "files-sdk/r2";
 *
 * const from = new Files({ adapter: s3({ bucket: "live" }) });
 * const to = new Files({ adapter: r2({ bucket: "backup", ... }) });
 *
 * // Incremental, pruning mirror — re-running only moves the delta.
 * const { uploaded, deleted } = await sync(from, to, {
 *   prefix: "uploads/",

 *   compare: "size", // cross-provider — etags aren't comparable
