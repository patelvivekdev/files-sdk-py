      Files SDK ships first-class tool factories for the most common LLM
      integrations. Each one wraps a configured <code>Files</code> instance into
      the shape that provider expects — same eight operations, same
      Zod-validated input contracts, same approval-gating defaults — so the
      model can browse, read, and (optionally) mutate your bucket through the
      same unified surface as your application code.

      Pick the subpath that matches your stack. Each is independently
      tree-shakeable and pulls in only the peer dependencies it needs.
